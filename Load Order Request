Priority Load Order Request

An int value to set load order of mods without requiring dependency statements. Default would be "1" with higher meaning later loading. If possible, a missing or undeclared load order would default to 1.

For example, I could set this mod https://github.com/DrBuckarooBanzai/cFixes to a value of 0 to be loaded before any other mod.  Higher numbers go later and thus on top of other mods.

Mods with the same load order load as they do now.  int would be part of the mod.json

"Priority": 1
